# HBT-EP plasma parameters 

This project shows the calculated plasma parameters for [HBT-EP tokamak](http://sites.apam.columbia.edu/HBT-EP/) at Columbia University.  

If you want to learn how to edit the .sm file, you can get started with [SMath](https://en.smath.com/view/SMathStudio/summary) by looking at some of the [written](https://en.smath.com/list/handbooks) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=smath+tutorial) tutorials.  

Please reach out to me if you want to collaborate on this project.
